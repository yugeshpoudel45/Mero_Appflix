I believe we had seen Jerry on TV once or twice (this was way back when a lot of people didn't have cable TV) and this series became the funniest thing on TV.  I watched it whenever I could but that wasn't enough. Finally, quite a few years later, I bought the DVD set and watched everything in order, plus I watched all of the extras.  It is awesome.   This is one of first series that I know of where you really needed to watch every episode in sequence to keep up with it.  Remember when TV shows had almost \"standalone\" episodes? You could watch them in any order and not get lost or confused or feel like you missed something. Not anymore.  Anyway, I know many people who didn't get it; 'it' being the Seinfeld/David humor...  but that's because they never would sit down for an entire episode to give it a chance.  And how can you expect someone to get it who can't pronounce \"Seinfeld\"??   It takes a very stubborn person to keep saying \"SeinFIELD\" even after you've corrected them a hundred times.",
